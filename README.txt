My project describes about my Portfolio.

It consists of 5 HTML pages.
1.about.html
2.work.html
3.education.html
4.skills.html
5.contact.html


about.html is the main page of this project and describes about me.I used <img> to render a picture of mine, used <nav> to navigate between different pages.
<div>,used <span> to incorporate inline elements,<h2>,<h4> header elements and CSS tags.I used keyframes property for increasing and decreasing image size

work.html displays the labs/assignments I have done so far in Javascript.If you click labs on the left side of the page,it displays the content of lab on the right side.I have used
Javascript for setting attribute to <iframe> for this.

education.html shows my Education(undergrad and grad) details with GPA.I used <table> for displaying Education details and also used rowspan attribute.I used jntulogo.jpg and DU_logo.png images for the logos of my Universities.
I used keyframes opacity property for images.


skills.html.It consists of a buttons that lists my technical skills.I used buttons and box-shadow, border-radius properties for displaying buttons.

contact.html displays my contact details and also the input forms to enter visitor data so that I can contact them.I used telephone and mailto links for my contact details and <input>,<form>,<fieldset>,<legend>,<textarea>,<select> for entering the visitor information.Used table for formatting the input contents.Used action attribute and post method.
Used Javascript for validating the visitor information.I made first name, last name, email address, mobile as required fields as these fields are necessary to contact visitor.It will validate firstname and lastname(shoud be alphabets only), email address(should be a valid email address) and mobile number(should be valid 10-digit only).
Submit button is disabled until all the required fields are filled. As you enter the page cursor directly places at first field and after entering the first required field only you can go to the next field.After clicking the submit button, page will direct you to the registration.html page.
